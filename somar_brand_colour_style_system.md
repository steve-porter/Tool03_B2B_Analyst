# Somar Consulting
## brand colour & style system

This document defines the **Somar Consulting visual system**. It is designed to be shared with **designers, developers, and AI tools** so that all outputs are visually consistent, restrained, and on-brand.

The goal is clarity, consistency, and calm authority. This is not a moodboard. It is a working system.

## 1. Colour system

Colours are defined by **role**, not decoration. No additional colours should be introduced unless they serve a clear functional purpose.

### 1.1 Foundational neutrals
These form the backbone of all layouts.

- **Primary background**  
  `#1C1C2B`  
  Use for main page backgrounds and full-screen sections.

- **Panel / surface**  
  `#232335`  
  Use for cards, containers, elevated sections.

- **Border / divider**  
  `#2F3045`  
  Use for outlines, separators, tables, and subtle structure.

---

### 1.2 Typography colours
Text colour is intentionally limited to preserve hierarchy and readability.

- **Primary text**  
  `#FFFFFF`  
  Headlines, body copy, primary labels.

- **Secondary / muted text**  
  `#C7C9D3`  
  Supporting copy, captions, helper text, metadata.

---

### 1.3 Accent colours (action only)
Accent colours indicate **interaction and intent**. They are not decorative.

- **Primary accent / CTA**  
  `#22D3EE`  
  Buttons, links, active states.

- **Accent hover / active**  
  `#06B6D4`  
  Hover, focus, and pressed states.

**Rule:** Accent colours should appear only where user action is expected.

---

### 1.4 System tokens (non-brand)
These support the UI but are not part of the brand palette.

- **Shadow**  
  `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.35)`

- **Corner radius**  
  `18px`

## 2. Typography system

### 2.1 Font family

- **Primary font:** Inter

Inter is used across all touchpoints:
- Website
- Tools and apps
- Presentations
- Documentation

**Guidelines:**
- Use Inter Regular, Medium, and SemiBold only
- Avoid excessive weight variation
- Prioritise readability over visual flourish

### 3.1 Core style

- Generous whitespace
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Grid-based layouts
- Few elements per screen

## 4. Usage guidance for humans and AI

When creating assets for Somar Consulting:
- Do not invent new colours
- Do not introduce additional fonts
- Use accent colour only for actions
- Prefer subtraction over addition
- When unsure, choose the simpler option

This system is intentionally restrained. Consistency matters more than novelty.
